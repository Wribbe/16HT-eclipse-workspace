Exercise 1:

Prevent the output of System.out to be mixed by using a semaphor.
To use a semaphor, import the package: se.lth.cs.realtime.semaphore.*, and 
instanciate a semaphor as follows:

	Semaphor mutex = new MutexSem();
	
	[...]
	mutex.take();
	System.out.print(line1);
	System.out.print(line2);
	[...]
	mutex.give();

The section between the take() and give() operation becomes a critical section,
which means that only the thread that has taken the mutex semaphor can print 
to System out.
